  description: As we have shared with you over the past several months, we are in the process of choosing the Senior Pastor for Polaris Church. The Board of Directors is following the process set forth by the church bylaws to make this decision. The Pastoral Search Committee was formed consisting of members of the church, church staff, board members, and members from the board of overseers to oversee this process.
