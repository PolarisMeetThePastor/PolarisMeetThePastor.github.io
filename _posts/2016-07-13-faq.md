## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What was the process the Pastoral Selection Committee used to review candidates?  
A: PSC has been working with Vanderblomen, a national search firm highly recognized across the country specializing in Church Staffing.  Vanderbloemen collected resumes from more than 100 potential candidates. They then reviewed those resumes using their proven innovative techniques to  present to the PSC team their top 7 recommendations (including Scott). Each of those 7 candidates then provided 2 or more recorded sermons for the PSC to watch along with resumes and a personal interview video. This list was then narrowed down to PSCâ€™s top 3 candidates. PSC then did their own interviews with the candidates, then voted for their top recommendation to the Board of Directors.  A majority vote from the PSC committee was required before any candidate would be presented to the congregation.

### Q: What criteria was used to select the candidate?  
A: Proven track record to lead a large organization (including a school), develop and grow a healthy church, outstanding communication skills and love for people and culture. Impactful, scripture-based messages, willingness to lead the way for community involvement and networking to always be building connections from the church to our surrounding community.  Strong, proven leadership qualities and passion for showing us all through example how we can be the hands and feet of Christ.  Each candidate was considered based on the same criteria and then ranked accordingly.
