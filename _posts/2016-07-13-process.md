## The Pastoral Search Process

As we have shared with you over the past several months, we are in the process of choosing the Senior Pastor for Polaris Church. The Board of Directors is following the process set forth by the church bylaws to make this decision.  
The Pastoral Search Committee was formed consisting of members of the church, church staff, board members, and members from the board of overseers to oversee this process.  
A well-respected national Search firm was then hired to begin screening candidates from across the country who meet the specifications for our Senior Pastor set forth by the Board of Directors. The search committee has spent countless hours reviewing applicants to narrow down those who would be considered. From this pool, the top seven were determined by the committee, of which Scott is one. They then submitted their top candidate to the board to be interviewed.  
The next step in the process is for this candidate to speak before the church. 
On August 7 you will have the opportunity to hear this candidate speak to our congregation. Weâ€™ll also have a meet and greet after service to meet him and his family and ask questions.  During the following week, the board welcomes your input and will field questions via email or phone call. This is a very significant decision in the life of our church and we ask you to pray this week for God's will to be revealed.
