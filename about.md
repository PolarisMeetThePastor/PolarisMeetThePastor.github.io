Honestly, I have no idea how to begin this note. I feel like I ought to say something profoundly spiritual or wise, but if you want to know what’s really bubbling up in my heart, it’s this: Hollie and I are just extremely excited—and quite overwhelmed—that the Pastoral Selections Committee have determined to present me to you as their candidate for senior pastor.
