Q: What was the process the Pastoral Selection Committee used to review candidates?<br>
A: PSC used a national search firm specializing in finding the perfect fit for our culture, our desire to grow, and to lead the several other ministries we have like the school and daycare. 
Vanderbloemen specializes in this field and are recognized as one of the top companies in this industry. Vanderbloemen collected resumes from more than 100 potential candidates and presented their top 6 recommendations to PSC.
Each candidate then provided 2 or more sermons for the PSC to watch along with resumes and a personal interview video. The list was then narrowed down to our top 3 candidates. PSC then voted for the recommendion to the Board of Directors.
